Webpack is the currently one of the hottest pieces of technology out there. It is quite difficult to understand in the beginning but I'd say Webpack is a really beneficial tool that optimizes your Web application. Let's first understand the basics.

Webpack is a module bundler for all your assets. In simple words, webpack processes all the modules and generates a bundle. 
As our application grows, we split it into multiple files, known as modules. A module could be a JavaScript function or a class. There are so many modules in our application and we use terms like ```import```, ```export```, ```require``` for exchanging the functionality of respective modules.

In this article, we're going to set up our React application using Webpack and Babel.
