# Hi! I'm Akhil.

<div align="center">

Thank you for coming here. I write mostly about Web Dev and JavaScript. I'm really passionate about how things work under the hood. In my leisure time, I play Ukulele, ride my Mountain Bike and listen to good ol' Rock and Roll. If you want to contact me, feel free to hit me up on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/_himalayan_).
